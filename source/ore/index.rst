Ore Documentation
=================

Our custom built plugin hosting solution provides a unique and convenient way for content creators to share and
make accessible plugins that they have created. For developers, Ore offers a centralized location where their users
can download, review, and get support on their plugin. For server administrators, Ore offers a level of safety and
security previously lacking from many Minecraft communities by requiring PGP signed uploads, offering two-factor
authentication on user accounts, and having our staff carefully review each upload.

Ore is currently still in beta and has only recently been introduced to a production environment. If you find an
issue with Ore that you believe is a bug, please take the time to report it to our
`issue tracker <https://github.com/SpongePowered/Ore/issues>`__.

If you need help using Ore, create a new topic on our
`Ore Support Forum <https://forums.spongepowered.org/c/plugins/ore-support>`__.

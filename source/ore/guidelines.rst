Ore Plugin Submission Guidelines
================================

Welcome to the Ore submission guidelines. This document provides an outline of our expectations for both project and file submissions.

Remember that these are just guidelines and the Ore team, referred to as the “staff” throughout these guidelines, may choose to allow
or disallow an action that is not explicitly listed here at our own discretion. 

--------

========
Projects
========

Submitted projects should meet the following expectations:


Name
~~~~

Your project’s submitted name should not include a version, tagline, or other description. The name should be unique and original
and must not have a name implying it is a Sponge project (e.g. *SpongeWarp* is not allowed, *Cool Warps for Sponge* is).


Main Documentation Page (Home)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the first page anyone sees when visiting your project. Information here should include a description of your project’s
features. The following, if present in your plugin, should be documented on the main page if not documented elsewhere on the Ore
project: commands, configuration, and permission nodes. Additionally, the below information must be documented on the main page
if relevant:


    **External Connections**

    If your project utilizes a web API, phones home to collect data, or otherwise connects to a system external to the server it is
    running on, the presence of this feature as well as information on how to enable or disable it must be displayed prominently on
    the main page. If your project’s sole purpose involves utilizing an external system (such as a Sponge plugin that translates
    chat between languages), a configuration option to toggle making connections to that service is not required. If your plugin
    sends information (for example, plugin list or player data), the information collected must be listed on the main page.

    Examples of systems that require documentation:

     - Statistics or usage information collection (‘metrics’)
     - Geolocation
     - Translation service
     - Web server that runs on the plugin, serving information to users
     - Server that runs on the plugin, listening to requests from other services
     - IRC/Discord/Telegram/WhatsApp bot or relay


Category
~~~~~~~~

The category you choose should be accurate. Your project should use the narrowest category possible rather than any category that
slightly applies. If no category appears accurate, the Miscellaneous category should be used.


Download Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ore provides, on each project page, a download button which will automatically choose the most recent release. If you wish to add
additional download links, all links must point to files hosted on Ore. In addition to links to approved files, you may link to
the download pages of unapproved Ore file submissions, but these links must not be recommended over any approved submission by
any means. This includes both explicitly marking a link to an unapproved file as recommended, or implicitly by making such links
as or more prominent than links to approved builds. Further, you must not attempt to circumvent any plugin warnings on Ore,
including warnings that inform the user that a project has not yet been reviewed.


Monetization / Advertising
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submissions may not be sold, nor may additional features be unlockable with payment. Advertisements and other revenue generating
links (e.g. adfly) are not permitted. The documentation may contain a link to a page to donate to the project maintainer or
other contributors as thanks but that page may not offer additional features or other plugins/mods for sale. 


“Cracked” / Offline-mode / online-mode=false Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projects that explicitly state they are designed for such uses are not allowed. Some projects, such as authentication systems,
may have functionality that can be useful for servers regardless of the server’s use of Mojang authentication, but they may not
promote this additional usage or be specifically designed for servers avoiding Mojang auth. Projects designed for proxies
requiring online-mode=false are allowed, provided they are not written to facilitate circumvention of Minecraft account ownership.


EULA
~~~~

We aim to comply entirely with the Mojang EULA. Any plugins, services, posts, and/or links suspected of violating the EULA may
be removed at the discretion of the Sponge Staff or at the request of Mojang AB.


Forks
~~~~~

Forks are permitted, provided they meet all items in the below list. Staff have the final say in what constitutes an accepted fork.
Follow the license of the parent project appropriately.

Either:

 - Contain significant changes warranting the creation of a new project. This is to avoid “I changed the message colors in
   Plugin X and now I claim credit!”, or
 - Continue a plugin that has been abandoned, with proof the author has not been answering messages or has stated the project
   will no longer be updated.
    
Acknowledge or credit the past plugin and developers. Essentially, don’t claim it is a new plugin and exclusively your creation.

--------

=====
Files
=====

Files submitted should meet the following expectations:


Obfuscation
~~~~~~~~~~~

A file that utilizes obfuscation will be denied unless it falls under the following exception:

    **NMS Obfuscation**

    This only applies for plugins which reference Minecraft or a Forge mod. Examples would be a plugin using Mixins or a plugin
    which doubles as a Forge mod (hybrid plugin). Provided that the only obfuscated references are to obfuscated source generated
    using ForgeGradle or VanillaGradle, the plugin is allowed to proceed through the review process.


Core Mods and Mixins: Modification of the Minecraft Base Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plugins and mods that use a system that modifies the Minecraft base code at runtime, (such as core mods and mixins) must disclose
the edits that they make to the Minecraft code, and their reasoning for them. Sponge plugins should use the Sponge API where
possible. Sponge implementations may implement technical restrictions to prevent such modifications from being applied by default.
Files are not permitted to attempt to work around these restrictions, but can notify the user that enhanced functionality can be
enabled via the Sponge provided configuration options.


External Connections (Web API, Phoning Home, etc.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many great features can be written by making calls to external systems. As well as being clearly documented in project descriptions,
such functionality should be configurable and disabled by default. If your project’s sole purpose involves utilizing an external
system (such as a Sponge plugin that translates chat between languages), connecting to that system does not need to be disableable.
If your plugin sends information (e.g. a plugin list, player data, or map data) to external systems, the information collected
must be listed on the main page (see above).


Execution of Downloaded Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a security risk we will not tolerate. This includes downloading jar or class files, generation of bytecode from downloaded
sources, and execution shell scripts.


Monetization / Advertising
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All functionality present in your plugin should be usable without restriction, and can not require a license key to operate.
External APIs, such as translation or geolocation services, that require payment for functionality can be allowed but must be
discussed among staff prior to approval. Plugins may not be used to display advertisements.


Update Checking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checking for updates should be performed using the provided Ore API. Your plugin may not link anywhere but Ore when directing
users of your plugin to download new versions. Note that this update checking counts as an external connection, which must be
documented and for which configuration must exist to disable it.

Privilege Granting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plugins must not grant or revoke feature access to any particular user or group of users determined by the plugin developer. 
This includes the author granting themselves a special display name or letting themselves use a special command. Features,
when applicable, should be locked behind permission nodes, rather than access being predetermined by the author. Commands
for granting specific, pre-programmed users OP or permissions are not acceptable.

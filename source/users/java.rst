Introducing Java
----------------

Java is a computer language used by programmers to develop their software, 
differing from many other languages in its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability.
This means that any program using Java, such as Minecraft, can run on any Operating System,
so long as that computer has hardware powerful enough to run the program. Java is able
to run on this wide variety of systems by creating a virtual computer known as the
"Java Virtual Machine", on which Java programs will run.

What's the Difference Between JRE and JDK?
------------------------------------------

**JRE**: The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is required to run any Java program on a system,
without it, the system cannot create the Java Virtual Machine. If you want to run a Sponge
(Minecraft) Server, you require the JRE.

**JDK**: The JDK (Java Development Kit) is used by Developers to create programs such as Minecraft,
as well as Mods and Plugins. If you do not need to do any coding and simply run a Server, you will
not need the JDK.


What's the Difference Between 32-bit and 64-bit?
------------------------------------------------

**32-bit**: 32-bit Java is the most common Java installation, due to it being the default download
for most systems. Due to the small maximum RAM allocation of ~1.6 GB, 32-bit is not recommended
for anything other than extremely small servers.

**64-bit**: 64-bit Java, while less commonly installed, has numerous advantages over 32-bit.
The amount of memory that can be allocated increases to approximately 3 TB, so you can throw
as much memory as your computer has towards your Server. 64-bit Java can also run faster than
32-bit, meaning that you can make the most of your processing power. We recommend 64-bit Java.

How to Install Java On Your Computer
------------------------------------

Download and install the latest version of the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) available for your operating system. Sponge (and Minecraft)
are built on Java 6, however you are recommended and encouraged to use Java 7.
Java 8 does not currently have widespread usage so installing it is not recommended.
Oracle Java is a good option for most Operating Systems.
If you are running a 64-bit Operating System, use 64-bit Java.

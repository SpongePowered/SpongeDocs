Other Platforms
===============

Sponge, as mentioned previously, provides both an API (a standard, like DVD) as well as one implementation or platform (like a DVD player). However, it's possible to use a different platform for running Sponge plugins.

We do provide a Forge-based platform, but this page details other options.
Please note that we do not provide support for users of these third-party platforms. 

Glowstone
=========

`Glowstone <http://www.glowstone.net/>`__ is an independently-made server for Minecraft. It does not contain any Minecraft code.

However, at the moment, Glowstone does not yet support the Sponge API but it is planned.

Granite
=======

`Granite <http://www.granitepowered.org/>`__ is another Sponge implementation built on top the Minecraft server.

Granite is not yet feature-complete, and only early development builds are available. Use at your own risk.

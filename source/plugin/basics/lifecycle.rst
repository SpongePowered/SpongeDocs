================
Plugin Lifecycle
================

Prior to any states that make the plugin visible, the plugin loader first sorts through the available plugins, determines if all dependencies are present, and sorts plugins by dependency order. Lifecycle events are given to plugins in this order. For example, plugin A containing "[required-]after:B" will get each event after plugin B has completed work for the given state.
Additionally, lifecycle states are global. This means that all plugins visible to each other must be transitioned through all states at once.

State Events
============

There are two categories of state events:

1. **Initialization:** When Sponge and plugins are loading, before the actual game has started. Initialization states only occur once.
2. **Running:** When the game and world are loading. Running states may occur multiple times.

Initialization States
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialization states only occur once during a single run.

**CONSTRUCTION**

The ``ConstructionEvent`` is triggered.
During this state, the ``@Plugin`` class instance for each plugin is triggered.

**PRE_INITIALIZATION**

The ``PreInitializationEvent`` is triggered.
During this state, the plugin gets ready for initialization. Access to a default logger instance and access to information regarding preferred configuration file locations is available.

**INITIALIZATION**

The ``InitializationEvent`` is triggered.
During this state, the plugin should finish any work needed in order to be functional. Global event handlers and command registration are handled during initialization.

**POST_INITIALIZATION**

The ``PostInitializationEvent`` is triggered.
By this state, inter-plugin communication should be ready to occur. Plugins providing an API should be ready to accept basic requests.

**LOAD_COMPLETE**

The ``LoadCompleteEvent`` is triggered.
By this state, all plugin initialization should be completed.

Running States
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running States can occur multiple times during a single run. ``SERVER_ABOUT_TO_START`` may follow ``SERVER_STOPPED``, and ``SERVER_STOPPED`` may occur at any point during the process if there is an error.

**SERVER_ABOUT_TO_START**

The ``ServerAboutToStart`` event is triggered.
The server instance exists, but worlds are not yet loaded.

**SERVER_STARTING**

The ``ServerStartingEvent`` is triggered.
The server instance exists, and worlds are loaded.

**SERVER_STARTED**

The ``ServerStartedEvent`` event is triggered.
The server instance exists, and worlds are loaded.

**SERVER_STOPPING**

The ``ServerStoppingEvent`` is triggered.
This state occurs immediately before the final tick, before the worlds are saved.

**SERVER_STOPPED**

The ``ServerStoppedEvent`` is triggered.
During this state, no players are connected and no changes to worlds are saved.

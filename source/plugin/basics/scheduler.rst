===================
Using the Scheduler
===================

Sponge exposes the `SchedulerService` to allow you to designate tasks to be executed in the future. The `SchedulerService`
provides a `TaskBuilder` with which you can specify task properties such as the delay, interval, name, (a)synchronicity,
and `Runnable` (see :ref:`task-properties`).

Working With the TaskBuilder
============================

First, obtain an instance of the `SchedulerService`, and retrieve the `TaskBuilder`:

.. code-block:: java

    import org.spongepowered.api.service.scheduler.SchedulerService;
    import org.spongepowered.api.service.scheduler.TaskBuilder;

    SchedulerService scheduler = game.getScheduler();
    TaskBuilder taskBuilder = scheduler.getTaskBuilder();

The only required property is the `Runnable <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html>`_, which you
can specify using `TaskBuilder#execute(Runnable runnable)`:

.. code-block:: java

    taskBuilder.execute(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            logger.info("Yay! Schedulers!");
        }
    });

Task Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the `TaskBuilder`, you can specify other, optional properties, as described below.

.. _TimeUnit: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html

+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Property        | Method Used             | Description                                                                      |
+=================+=========================+==================================================================================+
| delay           | delay(long delay)       | The amount of time in ticks before the task is to be run. Optionally, specify a  |
|                 |                         | TimeUnit_ as the second argument (applicable only for asynchronous tasks). If a  |
|                 |                         | `TimeUnit`  is not specified  for an asynchronous task, the specified time in    |
|                 |                         | ticks will be converted to the equivalent wall clock time.                       |
+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| interval        | interval(long interval) | The amount of time in ticks between repetitions of the task. If an interval is   |
|                 |                         | not specified, the task will not be repeated. Optionally, specify a TimeUnit_    |
|                 |                         | as the second argument (applicable only for asynchronous tasks). If a `TimeUnit` |
|                 |                         | is not specified for an asynchronous task, the specified time in ticks will be   |
|                 |                         | ticks will be converted to the equivalent wall clock time.                       |
+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| synchronization | async()                 | A synchronous task is run in the game's main loop in series with the tick cycle. |
|                 |                         | If `TaskBuilder#async` is used, the task will be run asynchronously. Therefore,  |
|                 |                         | it will run in its own thread, independently of the tick cycle, and will not be  |
|                 |                         | thread safe with game data.                                                      |
+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| name            | name(String name)       | The name of the task. By default, the name of the task will be                   |
|                 |                         | PLUGIN_ID "-" ( "A-" | "S-" ) SERIAL_ID. For example, a default task name could  |
|                 |                         | look like "FooPlugin-A-12". No two active tasks will have the same serial ID for |
|                 |                         | the same synchronization type. If a task name is specified, it should be         |
|                 |                         | descriptive and aid users in debugging your plugin.                              |
+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Last, submit the task to the scheduler using `TaskBuilder#submit(Object plugin)`.

And that's it! To summarize, a fully functional scheduled task that would run asynchronously every 5 minutes after an initial
delay of 100 milliseconds could be built and submitted using the following code:

.. code-block:: java

	import org.spongepowered.api.service.scheduler.SchedulerService;
	import org.spongepowered.api.service.scheduler.Task;
	import org.spongepowered.api.service.scheduler.TaskBuilder;

	SchedulerService scheduler = game.getScheduler();
	TaskBuilder taskBuilder = scheduler.getTaskBuilder();

	Task task = taskBuilder.execute(new Runnable() {
		public void run() {
			logger.info("Yay! Schedulers!");
		}
	}).async().delay(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).interval(5, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
        .name("ExamplePlugin - Fetch Stats from Database").submit(plugin);

To cancel a task, simply call the `Task#cancel` method:

.. code-block:: java

	task.cancel();

Asynchronous Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Asynchronous tasks should be used primarily for code that may take a significant period of time to execute, namely requests
to another server or database. If done on the main thread, a request to another server could greatly impact the performance
of the game, since the next tick cannot be fired until the request is completed.

Since Minecraft is largely single-threaded, there is little you can do in an asynchronous thread. If you must run a thread
asynchronously, you should execute all of the code that does not use the SpongeAPI/affect Minecraft, then register another
`synchronous` task to handle the code that needs the API. There are a few parts of Minecraft that you can work with
`asynchronously`, including:

* Chat
* Sponge's built-in Permissions handling

In addition, there are a few other operations that are safe to do asynchronously:

* Independent network requests
* Filesystem I/O (excluding files used by Sponge)

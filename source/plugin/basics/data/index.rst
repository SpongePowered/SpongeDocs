The Data API
============

Overview
========

The Data API is a powerful component of the SpongeAPI, providing standardized ways of accessing and modifying additional data that is not already encoded in the dataholders type. This section clarifies the basic concepts of the API and how to work with data manipulators and data holders. 

Further uses like serialization or the creation of custom data manipulators will be explained in the :doc:`advanced Section <../../advanced/data/index>`.

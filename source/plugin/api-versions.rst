It is recommended to always update to the latest stable version of the API or to an LTS version.

.. note::

    You may still choose to develop and release plugins against versions that have reached the end of support,
    but the Sponge team will not provide bug fixes or features to unsupported builds.


Getting the API Version from Implementations
============================================

Getting it from the Jar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* For `SpongeForge <https://www.spongepowered.org/downloads/spongeforge/>`__: 

  **Example:** ``spongeforge-1.12.2-2705-7.1.0-BETA-3361.jar``
  
  => API-Version ``7.1.0``
  
  See also :ref:`sponge-forge-file-name`.

* For `SpongeVanilla <https://www.spongepowered.org/downloads/spongevanilla/>`__:

  **Example:** ``spongevanilla-1.12.2-7.1.0-BETA-59.jar``
  
  => API-Version ``7.1.0``

.. note::

    The version string in SpongeForge & SpongeVanilla is currently flawed, it currently has a minor version number
    referring to **unreleased** API versions, and is planned to be fixed going forward in some future update.

    As we follow SemVer, changes in 7.1.0 should be backwards compatible with 7.0.0, as such, we often ship
    SpongeForge & SpongeVanilla with **preview** implementations of the upcoming API release.

    The API contained within the preview API builds can and will change before it's released, so for plugin
    compatibility sake, it's best to use plugins for the latest stable released API, and not the API preview versions.

    As such, if the API version number in the filename points to 7.2.0 but 7.2.0 is not yet announced to be released,
    you should use plugins built against 7.1.0 unless specifically testing new functionality as asked by plugin devs, or
    you are willing to put up with small breakages occasionally for the sake of new features.

    This **WILL** be fixed in the near future. When this happens the Version number of SpongeForge & SpongeVanilla will
    no longer reference unreleased SpongeAPI minor versions, but will still ship previews of the next minor API for
    testing purposes.

    Major API version bumps will be reserved for the experimental / bleeding builds, and will be very explicit as their
    major version number will be different.

Getting the Minecraft Version from Implementations
==================================================

Getting it from the Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* For `SpongeForge <https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge>`__ or
  `SpongeVanilla <https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeVanilla>`__:

  Go to the referenced SpongeCommon repository and check the ``gradle.properties`` in the project root. It contains an
  entry with the ``minecraftVersion``.
  
  .. note::
  
      The same works for the ``mcpMappings`` version.

* For `SpongeVanilla <https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeVanilla>`__ (only):

  Check the ``gradle.properties`` in the project root. It contains an entry with the ``minecraftVersion``.

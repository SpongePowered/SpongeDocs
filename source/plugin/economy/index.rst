Economy API
===========

Sponge provides an Economy API that unifies all economy plugins under the same API. The API can be used by both 
economy plugins providing the API, and other plugins using the API (i.e. shop plugin). This allows for all 
plugins that require an economy to work with any Sponge economy plugin.

Implementing the Economy API
============================

Sponge provides interfaces for economy plugins to implement and create an API. In order to build a complete Economy 
API, you must implement six classes:

- ``Currency``
- ``EconomyService``
- ``TransactionResult``
- ``TransferResult``
- ``UniqueAccount``
- ``VirtualAccount``

**Things to consider when implementing the Economy API:**

- Do I want to include support for multiple currency types?
- Do I want to my plugin to perform different actions when given different contexts?

Implementing the Economy API is fairly straightforward, and the `JavaDocs <http://jd.spongepowered.org>`_ can be a 
great tool if you are unsure what a method is supposed to do.

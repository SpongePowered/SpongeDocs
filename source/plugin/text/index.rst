Working with Text
=================

Formatted Text can be created using the ``Text.Builder``, as described in this section. The robust Text API can be used
in a variety of ways to combine styling, coloring, and Text actions.

Pagination, the process of splitting content (such as lists of Text) into discrete pages, will also be discussed in
this section.

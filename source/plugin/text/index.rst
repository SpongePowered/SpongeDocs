The Text API is used to create formatted text, which can be sent to players in chat messages and be used in
places such as in books and on signs.

Sponge uses the :doc:`Adventure <adventure:index>` library as its text implementation.
Since Adventure already provides docs on how to create and manipulate text objects,
we will supply you with Sponge-specific guides and a basic introduction.

Pagination, the process of splitting content (such as lists of Text) into discrete pages, will also be discussed in
this section.

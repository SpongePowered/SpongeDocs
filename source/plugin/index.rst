=================
Creating a Plugin
=================

This section is intended for developers who wish to develop plugins with SpongeAPI. The articles cover various
aspects of SpongeAPI and the concepts behind it. It is important to understand that the intent of this section is
to help developers get started with SpongeAPI, not to cover every concept. The
`Javadocs <https://jd.spongepowered.org/>`__ will be of great help to you once you are comfortable with the API.

.. note::

    It is suggested to have prior experience with developing in Java! It is also highly recommended to take code
    examples from the documentation as purely educational resources, as copying-and-pasting examples from the
    documentation likely will not work, especially without modification.

.. tip::

    The `Cookbook <https://github.com/SpongePowered/Cookbook>`__ is a collection of fully functional plugins that each
    demonstrate a specific part of the SpongeAPI. These plugin "recipes" are standalone and are compilable via Gradle
    or Maven. Some of them demonstrate how to create plugins using other JVM languages such as Scala and Kotlin. Note
    that some of the examples may not yet be updated for the latest API revisions!

=================
Creating a Plugin
=================

This section is intended for developers who wish to develop plugins with SpongeAPI. The articles cover various
aspects of SpongeAPI and the concepts behind it. It is important to understand that the intent of this section is
to help developers get started with SpongeAPI, not to cover every concept. The
`Javadocs <https://jd.spongepowered.org/>`__ will be of great help to you once you are comfortable with the API.

.. note:: 

    If you are familar with SpongeAPI 7 and need assistance migrating your plugin to SpongeAPI 8 or later, see
    :doc:`migrating-from-7-to-8`.

.. note::

    It is suggested to have prior experience with developing in Java! It is also highly recommended to take code
    examples from the documentation as purely educational resources, as copying-and-pasting examples from the
    documentation likely will not work, especially without modification.

.. tip::

    The `Test Plugin Suite <https://github.com/SpongePowered/Sponge/tree/api-8/testplugins>`__ is a collection of 
    fully functional plugins that each demonstrate a specific part of the SpongeAPI. These plugin "recipes" are 
    standalone and are compilable via Gradle or Maven.

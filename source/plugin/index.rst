Creating a Plugin
=================

This section is intended for developers who wish to develop plugins with the Sponge API. The articles cover various
aspects of the Sponge API and the concepts behind it. It is important to understand that the intent of this section is
to help developers get started with the Sponge API, not to cover every concept. The
`Javadocs <https://jd.spongepowered.org/>`__ will be of great help to you once you are comfortable with the API.

.. note::

    It is recommended to have prior experience with developing in Java! Copying-and-pasting examples from the
    documentation likely will not work, especially without modification.

.. tip::

    The `Cookbook <https://github.com/SpongePowered/Cookbook>`__ is a collection of fully functional plugins that each
    demonstrate a specific part of the SpongeAPI. These plugin "recipes" are standalone and are compilable via Gradle
    or Maven. Some of them demonstrate how to create plugins using other JVM languages such as Scala and Kotlin.

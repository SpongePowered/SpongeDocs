This section is dedicated to the different patterns that are useful in development. These range from
Optionals to Node-Trees, so if you have any ideas for a design pattern here is a good place to have them peer-reviewed.

.. note::

    It is recommended to have prior experience with developing in Java! Copying-and-pasting examples from the
    articles likely will not work, especially without modification.

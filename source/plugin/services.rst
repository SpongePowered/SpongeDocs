Services provide common server functionality that is intended to be provided by plugins so that plugins that wish to use
this functionality do not need to depend on any third-party plugins. Some services, such as the 
:javadoc:`PermissionService`, are tightly integrated into the API itself, providing the core functionality for some of
the API (for example, the ``PermissionService`` supports various methods on the :javadoc:`Subject` interface).

Services themselves can be :javadoc:`Server` scoped or :javadoc:`Game` scoped. Due to the potential for servers restarting
multiple times within a game instance, server scoped services should at least change instance across restarts, and may 
be provided different plugins.

.. note::
    In previous versions of SpongeAPI, plugins could register their own arbitary services to arbitary interfaces. This
    is no longer possible using the Sponge service provider in SpongeAPI 8 and later.

Obtaining a Service
===================

Services can be retrieved from the :javadoc:`ServiceProvider` via the ``serviceProvider`` method on either 
``Game`` or ``Server``. Inspect :javadoc:`ServiceProvider.GameScoped` and 
:javadoc:`ServiceProvider.ServerScoped` for details of what services are provided in these scopes.

Providing a Service
===================

Service implementations are provided during the generic :javadoc:`ProvideServiceEvent`. For example, to supply a
``PermissionService``, you would listen to the event like so (swapping out the "new" call for your service
construction code):

.. code-block:: java

    import org.spongepowered.api.event.Listener
    import org.spongepowered.api.service.ServiceProvider.ServerScoped
    import org.spongepowered.api.service.permission.PermissionService

    @Listener
    public void providePermissionService(final ProvideServiceEvent.ServerScoped<PermissionService> event) {
        event.suggest(() -> new ConcretePermissionService());
    }

It is important to note that it is possible that your listener will never get called. It is left up to the 
API implementation to decide which plugin to pick to provide a given service. With this in mind, it is highly
recommended that you do not construct your service implementation yourself, instead doing so within the 
:javadoc:`Supplier` supplied to the ``suggest`` method.

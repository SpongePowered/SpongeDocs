Setting Up Your Workspace
=========================

This section shows the basic setup for your IDE, to get yourself ready to develop Sponge plugins.

Currently we only provide documentation for the two most popular Java IDEs, IntelliJ_ and Eclipse_, 
but there are many other methods for developing Sponge plugins. Some choose to use Netbeans_ and 
others choose to simply use text editors such as `VS Code`_, Atom_, and `Sublime Text`_.

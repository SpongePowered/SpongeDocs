Optionals
=========

``Optional``\ s are a feature widely used in the SpongeAPI. This section tries to explain why we need them and how
they're used. If you already know why we use ``Optional``\ s, just head directly to the :doc:`usage` section. If you're
unsure what they are, what they do and why we need them, then :doc:`basic` should be the first chapter to read.

=============
IntelliJ IDEA
=============


You can download IntelliJ IDEA here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/


(Choose the "Community Version" unless you want to pay for the Ultimate Edition, or you can get it free as a student.
You do not need the Ultimate Edition to develop plugins, as the Community Version still contains all the tools you need.)

================
Create a project
================


Now that you have downloaded and started IDEA, create a new project. This should be fairly simple. Just be sure that you are
using at least Java 6. Then, right-click your project in the sidebar. Go to New > Directory. Keep doing this until you have a
valid package (an example would be src/main/java/com/google/exampleplugin) and make a class file. Then, continue.

IntelliJ IDEA
=============


You can download IntelliJ IDEA here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/


(Choose the "Community Version" unless you want to pay for the Ultimate Edition, or you can get it free as a student.
You do not need the Ultimate Edition to develop plugins, as the Community Version still contains all the tools you need.)

Now that you have downloaded and started IDEA, it's time to set things up. Click File > New Project and then go to the top of the window
that appears. Be sure you have set your 'Project SDK' to Java 1.8 (It should say "1.8 (Java Version 1.8.0_xx)" ) and click Next.
Now, click next again. You need to name your project. Name it to whatever you desire, however it should relate to your plugin.
You can also edit the path to the files. Click "Finish" when you are done.

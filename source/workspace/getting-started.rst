Overview
========

The Sponge Documentation provides a series of articles to help developers prepare their workspace for working on Sponge, the Sponge API, or plugins using the Sponge API. It is recommended to have prior experience with Java beforehand.

Documentation for **Preparing for Development** is presented in **tracks**, as each aspect of the Sponge project (Sponge, the Sponge API, and SpongeDocs) requires a different set of instructions. We advise following each track in the order specified below; however, this is up to you.

Creating a Server

Overview
========

What is this about?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The articles in this section explain how to create and run a server powered by an implementation of the Sponge API.

.. note::

    We attempt to be implementation-agnostic when possible, meaning that instructions generally aren't specific to one implementation of the Sponge API. Nonetheless, mistakes can happen.

Who should read this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section is intended for users who wish to create a new server using an implementation of Sponge or migrate an existing server to an implementation of Sponge. Plugin developers may also be interested in the articles contained within this section - test servers can be useful for plugin development.

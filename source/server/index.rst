Creating a Server
=================

The articles in this section explain how to create and run a server powered by an implementation of the Sponge API.

If you're a user who wishes to create a new server using an implementation of Sponge or migrate an
existing server to an implementation of Sponge, this is for you. Plugin developers may also be interested in the
articles contained within this section - test servers can be useful for plugin development.

.. note::

    We attempt to be implementation-agnostic when possible, meaning that instructions generally aren't specific to one
    implementation of the Sponge API. Nonetheless, mistakes can happen.

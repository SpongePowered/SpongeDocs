Installing Plugins
==================

What Are Plugins
================

Plugins are files written in Java that change the way the server works, generally adding features.
They allow server-owners to do a lot of modifications, such as adding an economy system, managing teleports and permissions, etc.

Finding Plugins
===============

.. warning::
    Do not download plugins from untrustworthy sources! Malicious plugins can be used to give others unauthorized access to your server or computer.

Installation
============

In order to install plugins, place them into the "mods" folder of your game or server directory.

If your download came in a .zip file, then you may need to extract it to find a .jar file inside.

Common Problems
===============

If you are having problems with a plugin, consider the following things:

* Is the plugin compatible with your Minecraft version? While Sponge tries to keep old plugins working, this is sometimes not possible. In most cases, plugins based on a stable release should continue functioning without being updated.
* Do you have a new enough Java version? While Sponge is built for Java 6 minimum, some plugins may require newer versions of Java such as 7 or 8.
* The plugin may be outdated. Is there a newer version of the plugin?
* Does the plugin need a specific Implementation and/or Build of Sponge?  Some plugins may bypass the Sponge API, or otherwise rely on details that change between versions or platforms. Check at the site you downloaded it from.

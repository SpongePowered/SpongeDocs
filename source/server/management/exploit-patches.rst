Exploit Patches
===============

In recent Sponge builds (SpongeForge 974+), SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla patch a few client-server exploits. Whenever
the implementations detect a user performing an exploit, they are kicked from the server with a message explaining why
they were kicked. If enabled, a log message is also sent to the console. More exploit patches may be added in the
future.

.. note::
  If you know about an exploit we currently *don't* cover, please let us know! You can contact us via
  `exploits@spongepowered.org <exploits@spongepowered.org>`_ or PM a staff member on the forums. Please **DO NOT** post
  exploits publicly on IRC, our GitHub repos or the forums, if they're still unknown. This prevents abuse until we
  get the issues fixed.

Exploits Patched implemented in Sponge
======================================

#. Sign command exploit where a client could run a command such as 'op'
#. Client could force the server to make the user respawn invisible
#. Client could set an itemstack's display name and cause it to exceed the character limit

Note that these patches can't be disabled, only the logging is configurable as of now.

.. warning::
    The invisibility exploit patch has been disabled in recent Sponge builds due to the detection method falsely
    accusing users of performing the exploit.

Log Message Control
===================

Log messages for the exploit patches can be individually controlled in the Sponge config file. Please read the
:doc:`../getting-started/configuration/sponge-conf` page for more information. Here's a short overview of available
options:

.. code-block:: guess

  # Log when server receives exploited packet with itemstack name exceeding string limit.
  exploit-itemstack-name-overflow=false

  # Log when player attempts to respawn invisible to surrounding players.
  exploit-respawn-invisibility=false

  # Log when server receives exploited packet to update a sign containing commands from player with no permission.
  exploit-sign-command-updates=false

.. tip::
    Log messages can also be controlled via a command, instead of directly editing the config file. For example, to
    enable the sign command exploit logging, type ``sponge config -g logging.exploit-sign-command-updates true`` in
    the console (You can also type the commands in-game if you are an op).

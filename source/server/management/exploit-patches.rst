Exploit Patches
===============

In recent Sponge builds (SpongeForge 974+), SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla patch a few client-server exploits. Whenever
the implementations detect a user performing an exploit, they are kicked from the server with a message explaining why
they were kicked. If enabled, a log message is also sent to the console. More exploit patches may be added in the
future.

Exploits Patched by Sponge Implementations
==========================================

#. Sign command exploit where a client could run a command such as 'op'
#. Client could force the server to make the user respawn invisible
#. Client could set an itemstack's display name and cause it to exceed the character limit

.. warning::
    The invisibility exploit patch has been disabled in recent Sponge builds due to the detection method falsely
    accusing users of performing the exploit.

Log Message Control
===================

Log messages for the exploit patches can be individually controlled in the Sponge config file. Please read the
:doc:`../getting-started/configuration/sponge-conf` page for more information.

.. tip::
    Log messages can also be controlled via a command, instead of directly editing the config file. For example, to
    enable the sign command exploit logging, type ``sponge config -g logging.exploit-sign-command-updates true`` in
    the console (You can also type the commands in-game if you are an op).

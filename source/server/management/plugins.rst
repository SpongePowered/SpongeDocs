Installing Plugins
==================

What Are Plugins
================

Plugins are files written in Java that change the way the server works, generally adding features. They allow server
owners to do a lot of modifications, such as adding an economy system, managing teleports and permissions, etc.

Finding Plugins
===============

.. warning::
    Do not download plugins from untrustworthy sources! Malicious plugins can be used to give others unauthorized access
    to your server or computer.

SpongePowered currently runs the `Ore platform <https://ore.spongepowered.org>`_ to make it easy for plugin developers
and users to distribute and download plugins. Alternatively you can search for plugins on the
`SpongePowered forums <https://forums.spongepowered.org/c/plugins>`_.

Installation
============

SpongeForge
~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to install plugins, place them into the ``/mods/`` folder of your game or server directory. If your download
came in a .zip file, then you may need to extract it to find a .jar file inside.

You can also place your plugins inside the ``/mods/plugins/`` subfolder or even set a custom folder in the
:doc:`global.conf<../getting-started/configuration/sponge-conf>` file via the ``plugins-dir`` setting. SpongeForge will
automatically search these folders for plugins. Please note that plugins which make use of ``Mixins`` *must* reside
inside the ``mods`` folder.

SpongeVanilla
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    For consistency between SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla, plugins are stored in the mods directory on SpongeVanilla.

In order to install plugins, place them into the ``/mods/`` folder of your game or server directory. If your download
came in a .zip file, then you may need to extract it to find a .jar file inside.

You can also place your plugins inside the ``/mods/plugins/`` subfolder or even set a custom folder in the
:doc:`global.conf<../getting-started/configuration/sponge-conf>` file via the ``plugins-dir`` setting. SpongeVanilla
will automatically search these folders for plugins. Please note that plugins which make use of ``Mixins`` *must* reside
inside the ``mods`` folder.

Common Problems
===============

If you are having problems with a plugin, consider the following things:

* Is the plugin compatible with your Minecraft version? While Sponge tries to keep old plugins working, this is
  sometimes not possible. In most cases, plugins based on a stable release should continue functioning without being
  updated. Please note that plugins might stop working if you switch to a different major version of the API, since
  major versions contain breaking changes. Refer to our `versioning scheme <../../contributing/versioning>` for more
  information.
* Do you run a current Java version? Sponge is built for Java 8 and is known to trigger a bug in the JRE 1.8.0_20, so
  make sure you use a version newer than that.
* The plugin may be outdated. Is there a newer version of the plugin?
* Does the plugin need a specific implementation and/or build of Sponge? Some plugins may bypass SpongeAPI, or
  otherwise rely on details that change between versions or platforms. Check at the site you downloaded it from.

Installing Plugins
==================

What Are Plugins
================

Plugins are files written in Java that change the way the server works, generally adding features.
They allow server-owners to do a lot of modifications, such as adding an economy system, managing teleports and permissions, etc.

Finding Plugins
===============

.. warning::
    Do not download plugins from untrustworthy sources! Malicious plugins can be used to give others unauthorized access to your server or computer.

Installation
============

Sponge Coremod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to install plugins, place them into the "mods" folder of your game or server directory.

If your download came in a .zip file, then you may need to extract it to find a .jar file inside.

SpongeVanilla
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: For consistency between Sponge Coremod and SpongeVanilla, plugins are stored in the mods direction on SpongeVanilla.

In order to install plugins, place them into the "mods" folder of your game or server directory.

If your download came in a .zip file, then you may need to extract it to find a .jar file inside.

Common Problems
===============

If you are having problems with a plugin, consider the following things:

* Is the plugin compatible with your Minecraft version? While Sponge tries to keep old plugins working, this is sometimes not possible. In most cases, plugins based on a stable release should continue functioning without being updated.
* Do you have a new enough Java version? While Sponge is built for Java 6 minimum, some plugins may require newer versions of Java such as 7 or 8.
* The plugin may be outdated. Is there a newer version of the plugin?
* Does the plugin need a specific Implementation and/or Build of Sponge?  Some plugins may bypass the Sponge API, or otherwise rely on details that change between versions or platforms. Check at the site you downloaded it from.

Quick Start
===========

.. hint::
    This quick start guide assumes that you want to use the Forge platform to run Sponge. See :doc:`the platforms page <platforms>` to see alternatives.

.. note::
    These instructions are subject to change until we are able to release Sponge for Forge.
    
Single Player / LAN Server
==========================

1. Download the correct `Forge version for your MC version <http://files.minecraftforge.net/>`_.
2. Run the downloaded Forge installer and use it to create a new Forge profile in the Minecraft launcher.
3. Open the Minecraft launcher and select the new Forge profile that was created.
4. Click "Options" and then click "Open Game Dir."
5. Download the `Sponge coremod <http://www.spongepowered.org>`_ and put it into the "mods" folder, creating the folder if it does not yet exist.


Dedicated Server
================

New Installation
----------------

1. Download the `Sponge server installer <http://www.spongepowered.org>`_.
2. Either double click the installer to automatically download the required server files, or if you are on the command line or terminal, use ``java -jar installer.jar`` to download the files.

Existing Forge Server
---------------------

If you already have a Forge server set up, get the `Sponge coremod <http://www.spongepowered.org>`_ and place it into your "mods" folder.


.. note::
    For new installations, you may need to manually configure :doc:`port-forwarding` on your router/modem to allow public access to your server.

=============

SpongeVanilla is a vanilla implementation of the Sponge API as a stand-alone server.


Overview
========

SpongeVanilla is an implementation of the Sponge API that is created by patching the vanilla Minecraft server.
This means it is a stand-alone server, and does not utilise nor require Minecraft Forge or Forge mod loader (FML).
SpongeVanilla is being developed in parallel to the Forge version of Sponge, as an alternative platform for users who do not want to run a Forge server.
Originally started as an independent project and named Granite, by developers **AzureusNation** and **VoltaSalt**, the SpongeVanilla team officially joined the Sponge development team in March 2015.

==========================
Choosing an Implementation
==========================

Overview
========

What is an implementation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Think of implementations like chocolate chip cookies. There are tons of bakeries that sell chocolate chip cookies, and each bakery may bake their cookies differently from one another. Yet, every cookie shares one thing in common: they all have chocolate chips.

When using the analogy of chocolate chip cookies:
* The Sponge API is a chocolate chip.
* The developers of each implementation are different bakeries.
* Each implementation of the Sponge API is a different brand of chocolate chip cookies.

There are currently two implementations of the Sponge API:

* **Sponge**: This is the official implementation of the Sponge API, created as a coremod for the Forge platform.
* **Granite**: This is an implementation of the Sponge API directly on top of the vanilla Minecraft server.

How do I know which one to choose?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is necessary to evaluate your individual needs to determine which implementation is best for you. SpongeDocs provides articles covering each implementation to aid in your decision.

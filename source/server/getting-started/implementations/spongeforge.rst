Installing SpongeForge
======================

SpongeForge integrates `Minecraft Forge <http://www.minecraftforge.net/>`__ so you can also run Minecraft Forge mods.
In fact, it's more like Sponge itself is a Forge mod that then loads Sponge plugins, but this is a technical detail.

Users who do not want to use Minecraft Forge can consider :doc:`spongevanilla`.

Download
========

Check :doc:`../../../downloads` for further information.

Reading the Download Filename
=============================

When you download SpongeForge, the name of the file will provide some important version information. It includes a
Forge build number which this version of SpongeForge is compatible with. Other builds, even ones differing by only a
few build numbers are not supported.

However, SpongeForge usually updates to a new Forge build fairly soon after it's released, so you needn't
worry about always having to run an outdated Forge version in order to use SpongeForge.


The format of the filename is ``spongeforge-{MCVersion}-{ForgeVersion}-{SpongeAPIVersion}-{SpongeBuildId}``

+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``MCVersion``        | The minecraft version. Only clients compatible with this version can connect.                |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``ForgeVersion``     | The version of Forge this file is built for. Preferably your server should run this exact    |
|                      | version of Forge.                                                                            |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``SpongeAPIVersion`` | The version of the SpongeAPI implemented by this file. This is what Sponge plugins depend on.|
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``SpongeBuildId``    | The build number of Sponge. This is what you should supply when reporting bugs or seeking    |
|                      | support.                                                                                     |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Example
~~~~~~~

The file name ``spongeforge-1.8-1577-3.0.0-BETA-1000.jar`` is compatible with minecraft version ``1.8``, requires build
``1.8-11.14.4.1577`` of Forge, provides SpongeAPI ``3.0.0`` and was build ``1000`` of SpongeForge.

.. note::

    Normal Forge mods can usually run on any build of Forge for a given minecraft version (e.g. 1.8.0) without
    any problems. However, SpongeForge needs to access, among other things, internal parts of Forge, which
    most mods shouldn't be touching, let alone modifying as Sponge does. Since Forge is free to change internal
    code whenever they want to, its normal guarantee of backwards-compatibility doesn't apply to SpongeForge.


Installing SpongeForge
======================

.. note::

    If you use (or are planning to use) a game server host, they may have a control panel that can install Sponge for you.


.. warning::
  When using the Mojang installer, Mojang makes use of their own Java version and not the one you installed on your
  system. The installer currently ships with Java ``1.8.0_25`` for Windows and ``1.8.0_60`` for OSX. Note that Sponge
  requires **at least** ``1.8.0_40`` or above to run properly. You can grab the Launcher without included Java here:
  `official Minecraft Launcher <https://minecraft.net/download>`_

Single Player / In-Game LAN Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the Minecraft Forge installer from the `Minecraft Forge website <http://files.minecraftforge.net/>`_. Make

:doc:`manage your instance of Sponge </server/management/index>` (including installing plugins).

Dedicated Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    If you already have a Forge server, just put the Sponge mod into your ``mods`` folder. Remember to update your Forge
    version to match the one that :doc:`sponge requires <spongeforge>`.

   Create the folder if it does not yet exist.
#. You may now launch the server via command or launch script ``java -jar forge-version-XYZ.jar``.
#. If operating from home, set up :doc:`../port-forward` to ensure others can connect.

Next, learn how you can create and use a :doc:`launch-script <../launch-script>`,
:doc:`how you can configure Sponge <../configuration/index>` and how to :doc:`how to manage your server

Migrating from Canary

Do Canary Plugins Work?
=======================

No, unfortunately there is no native support for Canary plugins in Sponge. (It may be possible to re-implement the Canary API with a special Sponge plugin, and thus support Canary plugins)


.. note::
  Although Canary plugins natively are incompatible with Sponge, it may be possible to convert the configuration files
  used by plugins. This depends on how (and if) each plugin is re-implemented in Sponge.
  The same can be said of database files and other data storage structures.

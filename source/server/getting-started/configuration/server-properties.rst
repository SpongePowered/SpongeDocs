Credit goes to the editors at the `Minecraft Wiki <http://minecraft.gamepedia.com>`__ for the explanations.

**Boolean** properties have only two valid values: *true* and *false*.
**Integer** properties must be whole numbers. Where a range is specified, the number must be in that range.
**String** properties can consist of any symbol.

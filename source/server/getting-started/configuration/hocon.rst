Introduction to HOCON
=====================

HOCON (Human-Optimized Config Object Notation) is an easy-to-use configuration format. It is used by Sponge and
individual plugins utilizing SpongeAPI to store important data, such as configuration or player data. HOCON files
typically use the suffix ``.conf``.

Components
==========

* a ``key`` is a string preceding a value
* a ``value`` is a string, number, object, array, or boolean following a ``key``
* a ``key-value separator`` separates keys from values, and can be either ``:`` or ``=``
* a ``comment`` is prefixed with ``#`` or ``//``, typically serving to provide feedback or instructions

**Example:**

.. code-block:: guess

      yellow-thing: "Sponge"

In this example, the ``key`` is ``yellow-thing``, the ``value`` is ``Sponge``, and the ``key-value separator`` is ``:``.

Working with HOCON
==================

HOCON is more flexible than the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format in that there are several ways to write valid
HOCON. Below are two examples of valid HOCON.

**Example #1:**

.. code-block:: text

    player: {
        name: "Steve",
        level: 30
    }

**Example #2:**

.. code-block:: text

    player {
        name = "Steve"
        level = 30
    }

In practice, it is best to follow the formatting conventions of the HOCON configuration you are editing. When editing
a HOCON configuration for Sponge or an individual plugin utilizing SpongeAPI, the values are likely the only thing
you will be changing unless otherwise specified.

Debugging your configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a HOCON configuration does not appear to be working, here are some tips.

* Curly braces must be balanced
* Quotation marks must be balanced
* Duplicate keys that appear later take precedence

Global Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The global.conf file contains the global configuration settings for Sponge. This file is created in the config/sponge
directory in your server folder. Many of these properties can be also overridden per-world or per-dimension type by
using the config files in the subfolders of config/worlds.

Below is a table with all available settings inside the global.conf file. Note that certain sections will not be filled
immediately, and may optionally be added to the file when the server encounters them. There's also full example of a
unmodified ``global.conf`` file at the bottom of this page, below the following table:

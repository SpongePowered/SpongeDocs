Global Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The global.conf file contains the global configuration settings for Sponge. This file is created in the config/sponge
directory in your server folder. Many of these properties can be also overridden per-world or per-dimension type by
using the config files in the subfolders of config/worlds. The following global.conf example was generated by a server
running the beta build of SpongeForge (build 1000) and Forge 1.8 (build 1577).

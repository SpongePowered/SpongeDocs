Global Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The global.conf file contains the global configuration settings for Sponge. This file is created in the config/sponge
directory in your server folder. Many of these properties can be also overridden per-world or per-dimension type by
using the config files in the subfolders of config/worlds.

Below is a complete global.conf file with all possible nodes that may be present on a server. Note that certain
sections will not be present immediately, and will be added to the file when the server encounters them. This config
was generated using SpongeForge build 1360, SpongeAPI version 4.1:

Port Forwarding
===============

If you are running your Sponge server from your home, you may need to set up Port Forwarding on your modem or router in order for others to connect. You may need to port-forward your hardware if your server is not online when you start up.

Minecraft (and thus Sponge) uses port 25565 by default; however, this can be changed in your :doc:`server-properties`. UDP and TCP are the protocols that must be forwarded.

The process of port forwarding is dependent on the model of your router or modem. Typically, instructions and manuals can be found online.

.. warning::
    Beware of vendors attempting to sell you software to port forward a server. Software is unnecessary to set up port forwarding.

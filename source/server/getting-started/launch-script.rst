Creating a Launch Script
========================

.. note::

    These instructions apply only if you plan to run your Minecraft server on your own machine. Most shared Minecraft
    hosts will create a launch script for you.

Writing a Launch Script
=======================

First, open a text editor such as Atom, Sublime Text, or Notepad. Write (or paste) a launch script for your server.
Examples of simple launch scripts for Windows, macOS, and Linux have been provided below. Keep the RAM limitations
of your machine in mind.

.. note::

    The following examples are generic. For a Forge server using Sponge (coremod), change ``forge-1.8-XYZ-universal.jar``
    to whatever your Forge version in the server directory is named. To launch a SpongeVanilla server, change
    ``forge-1.8-XYZ-universal.jar`` to the name of the SpongeVanilla.jar file.

Windows
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    java -Xms1G -Xmx2G -jar forge-1.8-XYZ-universal.jar
    pause

Save your Windows launch script as ``launch.bat``.

macOS
~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    #!/bin/bash
    cd "$(dirname "$0")"
    java -Xms1G -Xmx2G -jar forge-1.8-XYZ-universal.jar

Save your Mac launch script as ``launch.command``.

Linux
~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    #!/bin/sh
    cd "$(dirname "$(readlink -fn "$0")")"
    java -Xms1G -Xmx2G -jar forge-1.8-XYZ-universal.jar

Save your Linux launch script as ``launch.sh``.

Running a Launch Script
=======================

Ensure you are running your launch script out of a folder created especially for your server. This is for your own
sanity; unfortunately, Spongie is unable to soak up your tears if you do not do this.

You may run your launch script by double-clicking it. If you are using a console or terminal, navigate to the directory
of the script and run it. Keep in mind that you must agree to the Mojang EULA in order to run a server.

.. note::

    The default Minecraft server GUI console is disabled by Sponge, because it is very processor-intensive.

.. warning::

    If you get a permissions error when attempting to launch your server on a Mac, try this:

    * Open the Terminal.
    * Type ``chmod a+x``, with a space at the end.
    * Drag your launch script to the Terminal.
    * Press enter.

Commands
========

Commands are one method in which server operators can administer their server, and in which players can interact with
the server.

In Sponge, commands follow a system of permissions. Permissions allow server operators to control who can access what
commands. By default, all commands are granted to players with OP status. Players without operator status do not have
access to administrative commands or commands that require an assigned permission node. A server operator can fine-tune
who can access what commands by adding/negating permission nodes through a permissions plugin.

.. note::

    Sponge is not a permissions-management plugin. To add and negate permissions for individual players or groups, you
    will need to find a permissions-management plugin.

Operator Commands
=================

These commands, in addition to regular player commands, are available to server operators.

Sponge
~~~~~~

The following commands are available to players with operator status (or the correct permission node) on servers powered
by Sponge.

======================  ========================================  =============================
Command                 Description                               Permission
======================  ========================================  =============================
/sponge audit           Forces loading of unloaded classes to     sponge.command.audit
                        enable mixin debugging.
/sponge chunks          Prints out the chunk data for a world, a  sponge.command.chunks
                        dimension, or globally.

                        config.
/sponge heap            Dumps the JVM heap.                       sponge.command.heap
/sponge plugins         Lists currently installed plugins.        sponge.command.plugins

                        procedures.

**Sponge Command Parameters**

* /sponge chunks [-g] [-d dim] [-w world]
* /sponge config [-g] [-d dim] [-w world] key value
* /sponge save [-g] [-d dim|*] [-w world|*]
* /sponge reload [-g] [-d dim|*] [-w world|*]

.. note::

    The ``/sponge audit`` command forces loading of any classes which have not yet been loaded, allowing the full output
    from all mixin debugging environment variables to be captured. This also requires the mixins.checks variable, see
    the `Mixin wiki <https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin/wiki/Mixin-Java-System-Properties>`__ for more information.

.. tip::

    Here are a few simple examples of the sponge config command in action. Please see
    :doc:`../getting-started/configuration/index` for a more detailed explanation.

    a. ``/sponge config logging.chunk-load true``

      Since no dimension was specified, the dimension would default to the sender(player) dimension. So if you were in a
      mystcraft dimension, this would alter the mystcraft dimension config.

    b. ``/sponge config -d nether logging.chunk-load true``

    Since a dimension type was specified, this would alter the nether dimension config (and hence all nether worlds).

    c. ``/sponge config -w DIM1 logging.chunk-load true``

    This would alter the config of world named DIM1.

Timings
~~~~~~~

Timings are a tool built into Sponge that allows server administrators to monitor the performance of their server.
Timings will collect information about a server so that a report may later be generated on the data. Information that
is recorded by timings include the server motd, version, uptime, memory, installed plugins, tps, percent of tps loss,
amount of players, tile entities, entities, and chunks.
Below is a list of sub-commands to ``/sponge timings``:

========================  ========================================
Command                   Description
========================  ========================================
/sponge timings on        Enables timings. Note that this will
                          also reset timings data.
/sponge timings off       Disables timings. Note that most timings
                          commands will not function and timings
                          will not be recorded if timings are
                          disabled.
/sponge timings reset     Resets all timing data and begins
                          recording timing data after the time
                          this command was done.
/sponge timings report    Generates the timings report on your
                          server performance at
                          http://timings.aikar.co
/sponge timings verbon    Enables timings monitoring at the
                          verbose level.
/sponge timings verboff   Disables timings monitoring at the
                          verbose level. Note that high-frequency
                          timings will not be available.
/sponge timings cost      Gets the cost of using timings.
========================  ========================================

Forge
~~~~~

The following commands are available only when using the SpongeForge coremod on Forge. Other implementations of the
Sponge API, such as SpongeVanilla, do not include these commands.

====================  ========================================  ====================
Command               Description                               Permission
====================  ========================================  ====================
/forge tps            Display ticks per second for each world.  forge.command.forge
/forge track          Enable tile entity tracking.              forge.command.forge
====================  ========================================  ====================

|

For any Forge mods that use the vanilla command API, command permissions are provided in the form ``<modid>.command.<commandname>``.


Vanilla
~~~~~~~

There are several commands built-in to vanilla Minecraft that are also available on servers powered by Sponge. The list
below is not comprehensive, but it includes the most commonly used commands. These commands are available to players with
operator status (or the correct permission node). In general, permissions for vanilla Minecraft commands on a Sponge
server are of the structure ``minecraft.command.<command>``, as shown below.

====================  ========================================  ================================

Sponge also creates a spawn-protection bypass permission, and two permissions for controlling the
ability to edit commandblocks. Note that these permissions use the actual *name* of the commandblock,
which is normally ``@`` by default. 

* Allow player to bypass spawn-protection on all worlds: ``minecraft.spawn-protection.override``
* Allow editing an ordinary commandblock of the given name: ``minecraft.commandblock.edit.block.<name>``
* Allow editing a minecart commandblock of the given name: ``minecraft.commandblock.edit.minecart.<name>``


Player Commands
===============

The following commands are available as part of vanilla Minecraft to players without operator status.

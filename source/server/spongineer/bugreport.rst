Reporting Bugs
==============

If you've encountered a bug and you're unsure on how to report it, this is the page to look at.
We're currently handling all bug reports through our issue trackers on GitHub and via the forums.

If there's an issue with SpongeForge, report it on the `SpongeForge issue tracker <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeForge/issues>`_.
The same applies for SpongeVanilla (`SpongeVanilla issue tracker <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeVanilla/issues>`_)
and even the Docs (`SpongeDocs issue tracker <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeDocs/issues>`_).

Whenever you report a bug, please include the following:

* Sponge version used (SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla build number)
* Forge version (if applicable)
* any other mods or plugins installed including their versions
* your :doc:`logs`

 * please use a service like `GitHubs gist <http://gist.github.com/>`_ or `pastebin <http://pastebin.com/>`_ to provide
   logs, *don't* paste them into the post directly

* your crash report (optional, not necessarily created)

Please make sure you already read through our :doc:`debugging`, :doc:`troubleshooting` and :doc:`logs` sections. If the
problem still persists, then file a bug report.

Here's a short example, you may copy and use it when opening a ticket on GitHub. Note that this is just a suggestion,
its usage is optional and you may modify it to suit your needs:

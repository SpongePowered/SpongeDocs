Reporting Bugs
==============

If you've encountered a bug and you're unsure on how to report it, this is the page to look at.
We're currently handling all bug reports through our issue trackers on GitHub.

If there is something wrong with the API or a feature missing you would like to see for developing
plugins, please report it on the `SpongeAPI issue tracker <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeAPI/issues>`_.

If there is something wrong with the server and you think the issue is only with SpongeForge or with mod interaction,
report it on the `SpongeForge issue tracker <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeForge/issues>`_. If it is only
occurring on SpongeVanilla then report it on the
`SpongeVanilla issue tracker <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeVanilla/issues>`_, but if the issue occurs with
both implementations please report it on
`SpongeCommon issue tracker <https://github.com/spongepowered/spongecommon>`_.

If you have an issue with the docs themselves, you can report it on the 
`SpongeDocs issue tracker <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeDocs/issues>`_.

Before submitting an issue please make sure you have already read through our
:doc:`debugging`, :doc:`troubleshooting` and :doc:`logs` sections. If the problem still persists, then file a bug
report, utilizing the issue template provided by GitHub when you click the ``New Issue`` button and fill out everything
applicable. If the project lacks an issue template, please make sure to include as much relevant information as
possible.

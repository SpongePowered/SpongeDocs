Reporting Bugs
==============

If you've encountered a bug and you're unsure on how to report it, this is the page to look at.
We're currently handling all bug reports through our issue trackers on GitHub.

If there's an issue with SpongeForge, report it on the `SpongeForge issue tracker <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeForge/issues>`_.
The same applies for SpongeVanilla (`SpongeVanilla issue tracker <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeVanilla/issues>`_)
and even the Docs (`SpongeDocs issue tracker <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeDocs/issues>`_).

Whenever you report a bug, please include the following:

* Sponge version used (SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla build number)
* Forge version (if applicable)
* any other mods or plugins installed including their versions
* your :doc:`logs`

  * please use `GitHub's gist <https://gist.github.com/>`_ service to provide
    logs, *don't* paste them into the post directly

* your crash report (optional, not necessarily created)

Please make sure you already read through our :doc:`debugging`, :doc:`troubleshooting` and :doc:`logs` sections. If the
problem still persists, then file a bug report. When doing so, use the issue template provided by GitHub that you see when 
you click the "New Issue" button and fill out everything applicable.

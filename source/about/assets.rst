This page provides the official SpongePowered logo and mascot. Feel free to use them to spread the word about Sponge.
However note that these images are **not** provided under the MIT License.

.. note::
  If you're reading a translated version, please note that the English license is the one which counts. Translated
  licenses are only provided for informational purposes.

You may:

* Make minor modifications to Spongie’s facial expressions - such as making a cute smile,
  making them perplexed or sad, adding a hat, and so on. It should be easily recognizable that the Spongie you create
  is the Spongie mascot, but wearing a different expression or clothing.

* Use Spongie or the SpongePowered logo in an article or blog post about the Sponge project, and to spread the word.

* Use the SpongePowered Logo to link to `Sponge Homepage <https://www.spongepowered.org>`__
  (for example in your signature on forums etc.)

You may not:

* Use the mascot as a link to the Sponge project only. The SpongePowered logo (which retains Spongie’s form) is a better
  representation of the Sponge project when used as an affiliate or reference.

* Create a vastly modified version of Spongie, where they become unrecognizable or clearly different from the
  original Spongie mascot.

* Add your project image to Spongie, or vice versa.

* Claim Spongie as your own mascot, or use them as a mascot for your own project.

* Sell or use Spongie in commerce without permission.

* Change any colors or dimensions.

The History of Sponge
=====================

This page is split into two main parts:
 * the history of the project itself
 * the history of our beloved mascot Spongie

The History of the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sponge was founded as a better alternative to the APIs that were available as of
September 2014. The Sponge :doc:`staff` consists of many people from
different Communities, eg. Spout/Spoutcraft, Forge, Cauldron and a few others.

When the development of Bukkit, Cauldron and MCPC+ were halted by a DMCA
take-down notice, the Minecraft community was shocked. Several developers from
the above mentioned communities gathered in #nextstep on Esper.NET and discussed
the future of Minecraft modding. It was decided that there certainly was a
demand for a new API as the CraftBukkit repository (Cauldron too)
was taken down.

Several goals should be achieved with the new API:
 * consistent
 * stable across Minecraft updates
 * easy to use
 * compliant with the Mojang EULA
 * provide best possible protection against DMCA takedowns

While the goals were mostly clear, the route to be taken was not. The
soon-to-be Project was still nameless too. The first mention of Sponge as the
projects name was on Sept, 6th by Firehead94. Obviously the name stuck.

The initial commit to SpongeAPI and the Sponge Forge Coremod
was made on September 7th and 8th, 2014 by one of the Sponge
Project leaders, Zidane. This was the beginning of the development of the
SpongeAPI and the Sponge Coremod.

On September 7th, 2014 the initial commit to Granite, an API based upon Vanilla Minecraft
was made. Granite, originally started as an independent project, was planned to
implement it's own API and the SpongeAPI. Granite and the Sponge Coremod
coexisted until April 20th, 2015.

The development of Sponge and the API gained momentum leading to a first API
release on December 1st, 2014. However this version was far from feature complete and
an API-only release, meaning that there was no official implementation available
at that time.

On December 26th, 2014 the Granite Team decided to limit Granite to the usage of SpongeAPI.
That made Granite the first unofficial Sponge Implementation for Vanilla Minecraft.
On March 26th, the Granite Team finally joined the Sponge Team and Granite became
SpongeVanilla, the official SpongeAPI implementation for Vanilla Minecraft.
About a month later the unification of the Granite and Sponge (Coremod) codebase
began in SpongeCommon. SpongeCommon was created to hold all shared code between
the two implementations while implementation-specific code remains in SpongeVanilla
and Sponge.

On April 21st, 2015 SpongeAPI 2.0 was finally released. A week later development builds
of the Sponge Coremod were finally made available.



Spongie - our Mascot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spongie is our friendly, helpful and somewhat soaky mascot. Don't make her cry,
as she's a very sensitive person.

The History of Spongie
----------------------

Spongie first appeared in #Sponge on Esper.NET around September 2014.
She was created and posted by `DragonsPainter <http://dragonspainter.deviantart.com/>`__.
Strad, another user, felt that Spongie would look better with a moogle-like
antenna, a Forge furnace instead of a Cauldron and replaced the Spigot with
Spout. An anonymous user then removed all labels and introduced her as the icon
and background logo for the Sponge reddit section.

This older version of Spongie sadly isn't available as vector graphic.
Thus Sponge staff decided to create a new vectorized version. Two new drafts
were then posted on `State of Spongie <https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/state-of-spongie-wip/6194>`__.

The final decision on Spongie is still pending.

====================
Plans for the Future
====================

There is a lot we would like to do. Specifically:

* If Mojang releases an official modding API, we are interested in building the SpongeAPI on top of Mojang's modding
  API so Sponge plugins will work on both.
* We may support client-side Sponge mods that could perform a variety of functions related to the client.

There are also some things we have decided not to do:

* We will not support Bukkit plugins natively.
* We will not send Forge mods from the server to the client because of security concerns.
* We will not develop implementations using other programming languages, but we encourage others to do so. Our focus is
  on Java.

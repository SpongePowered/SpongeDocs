Forum Posting Guidelines
========================


Read Before Posting
-------------------

If you are confused or curious about Sponge, we strongly recommend reading the :doc:`faq`.

Please refrain from posting topics asking for basic information about Sponge, like *"Is Sponge a Forge mod"*, *"When
will Sponge be released"*, etc. Answers to those questions can be found here in SpongeDocs.

Before you post a new topic on Sponge Forums, please make sure it's not redundant questions or information! Use the
Search feature (top right of page) or check the ``Your topic is similar to...`` box that appears above the pane when
creating a new topic (it updates as you add stuff to your topic). If there is a similar topic, you should probably
continue your discussion there!

Discussions about other APIs are allowed so long as they don't turn nasty.

Still need more info? Take a look at the Sponge resources in the :doc:`/index`, check the `Forum Announcements
<https://forums.spongepowered.org/c/announcements>`__, or to track Sponge's progress, `follow them on Twitter
<https://twitter.com/SpongePowered>`__ or watch `Sponge GitHub <https://github.com/SpongePowered>`__. If you are really
keen to help development, look at :doc:`/contributing/index`.


Forum Rules
-----------

- A complete list of rules and guidelines for Sponge Forums can be found in :doc:`rules`.


Categorizing Your Posts
-----------------------

When creating new topics, use the drop-down menu to the right of the topic title to set its category. Try to make sure
this category fits what you're posting about. If you don't know what a category implies, a description is next to each
one in the drop down.


**Thanks for reading & welcome to the Sponge community!**

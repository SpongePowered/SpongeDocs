Forum Posting Guidelines
========================


Read Before Posting
-------------------

If you are confused or curious about Sponge, we strongly recommend reading the :doc:`faq`.

Please refrain from posting topics asking for basic information about Sponge, like *"Is Sponge a Forge mod"*, *"When
will Sponge be released"*, etc. Answers to those questions can be found here in SpongeDocs.

Before you post a new topic on Sponge Forums, please make sure it's not redundant questions or information! Use the
Search feature (top right of page) or check the ``Your topic is similar to...`` box that appears above the pane when
creating a new topic (it updates as you add stuff to your topic). If there is a similar topic, you should probably
continue your discussion there!

Discussions about other APIs are allowed so long as they don't turn nasty.

Still need more info? Take a look at the Sponge resources in the :doc:`/index`, check the `Forum Announcements
<https://forums.spongepowered.org/c/announcements>`__, or to track Sponge's progress, `follow them on Twitter
<https://twitter.com/SpongePowered>`__ or watch `Sponge GitHub <https://github.com/SpongePowered>`__. If you are really
keen to help development, look at :doc:`/contributing/index`.


Forum Rules

- A complete list of rules and guidelines for Sponge Forums can be found in :doc:`rules`.


Categorizing Your Posts
-----------------------

When creating new topics, use the drop down menu to the right of the topic title to set it's category. Try to make sure
this category fits what you're posting about. If you don't know what a category implies, a description is next to each
one in the drop down.

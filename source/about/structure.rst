The Structure of the Sponge Project
===================================

The Sponge Project consists of different subprojects, hosted in various repositories on GitHub. Here's a short overview
before going into detail:

SpongeCommon, SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla
===========================================

The SpongeCommon repository is the base which contains all code which is shared between the SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla
implementation. The SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla repositories contain all code which can't be shared between them, as
Forge requires some Forge specific things which won't work on Vanilla and vice versa.

When you refer to the SpongeForge implementation, you're basically talking about everything contained in the
SpongeCommon and SpongeForge repositories. The same applies for SpongeVanilla and SpongeCommon. This is the reason why
building SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla from the repository *without* including SpongeCommon won't work.

SpongeHome
==========

SpongeHome is the SpongeProject's website. It's written in Golang, using the go-macaron library. It uses SCSS as it's
CSS preprocessor.

Ore
===

Ore is our very own plugin hosting solution. It's written in Scala, based on the Play Framework and of course open-source!

How everything is tied together
===============================

The image shows the various parts of the Sponge Implementations and how they interact with each other and their dependencies.
On the left side is a typical SpongeForge setup with some SpongeAPI plugins, a Forge mod and a hybrid which uses Forge
(as a mod) and Sponge (as a plugin) to interact. On the right side there's a typical SpongeVanilla setup. You'll notice
that SpongeVanilla doesn't support Forge mods or the hybrid, because SpongeVanilla is missing the Forge functionality:

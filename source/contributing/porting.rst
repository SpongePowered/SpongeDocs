Porting Sponge to Other Platforms

Currently, two official Sponge implementations are being developed:

If you plan to implement the SpongeAPI on another platform, please make sure to provide all needed dependencies.

Expected Dependencies
=====================

Plugin developers expect the following dependencies to be bundled with implementations:

* Guava
* Guice
* Gson

==================
SpongeDocs Writing
==================

Overview
========

The Sponge documentation, also referred to as "SpongeDocs," is the official documentation of the Sponge project. The
goal of SpongeDocs is to:

* Help users set up their own servers powered by a Sponge implementation.
* Provide developers with information on how to contribute to the Sponge project.
* Provide developers with information on how to get started with plugin development.

Writing the Docs
================

Changes and additions to SpongeDocs should be submitted as a pull request to the `SpongeDocs repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeDocs>`__.


Style Guide
===========

To make sure we have consistent format across all SpongeDocs pages, here are the guidelines we have developed for
writing Sponge Documentation. This list may get added to (or bent out of shape) as the Docs get bigger.

1. Headings Should Be Written in Title Case (<- example) [unless #8 applies].
2. Page headings should be meaningful (the heading appears as a link).
3. Program code should be contained in `inline literals <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/roles.html#literal>`__
   or code blocks.

  i. Try not to put too much text in code blocks, as they cannot be translated.
     Contributors are discouraged from commenting in code blocks wherever possible. Simple place-holder text may be
     necessary in some examples. Ideally, code block examples will be short, and followed by an explanation for each
     example in the body text. Of course, there may be some concepts that cannot be illustrated with a short example.

4. Keep separate areas for Users, Plugin Devs, and Sponge Devs.
5. Avoid repetition by sharing pages where possible.
6. Link to external resources rather than reproduce them.

  i. Some exceptions are made for translation purposes.

7. Make distinction between Sponge Coremod, SpongeVanilla and SpongeAPI.
8. If it looks awful in your language, invent your own rules.
9. Sponge is the Project Title and should NOT be translated.

  i. Some languages may wish to use a phonetic translation as well.

10. Automated translations (eg. Google Translate) are strongly discouraged. These often contain serious errors, and are
    very likely to be rejected.
11. Page Titles and Section Headings should be plain text, avoiding literal blocks and other formatting.
12. Code symbols should be capitalised in their original form and have no extra spaces (eg. blockState (a field name) or
    BlockState (a class name), rather than *block state*). They should also be formatted as a literal using double
    backticks (eg. ``blockState``) in body text.


.. Note::

    As Sponge is still in a state of flux, a shortfall of development docs is to be expected. Until official release of
    Sponge, there are sure to be voids in many subjects. Nevertheless, SpongeDocs is a living document, always subject
    to edit. It's never going to be perfect, just beaten into shape as needs demand.

*Contributions, suggestions and corrections are always welcome.*

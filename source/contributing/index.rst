Contributing to Sponge
======================

This sections intends to show you ways to get involved with Sponge.

What are the projects I can help with?
======================================

The Sponge Project and its parts are maintained on `GitHub <https://github.com/spongepowered>`_. If you're unfamiliar
with GitHub and the tool git, then take a look at :doc:`howtogit` first. A read of our :doc:`guidelines` is strongly
advised before starting any work. There are several projects we're currently maintaining:

* SpongeAPI
* SpongeForge
* SpongeVanilla
* SpongeCommon
* Mixin
* SpongeDocs
* Ore

If you want to know more about the structure of the project and how everything is tied together, head over to
:doc:`../about/structure`.

What kind of help is needed?
============================

Basic contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This can be done by almost everyone. You don't need to know a programming language like Java or Python to:

* test SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla and report bugs or usage quirks
* report or suggest any errors, faults or bugs you encounter
* post suggestions or idea you have which would make Sponge better

Reporting bugs best via our `GitHub repositories <https://github.com/spongepowered/>`_, suggestions fit onto our
`forums <https://forums.spongepowered.org/>`_. Just have a look at our
:doc:`Bug Reporting page <../server/spongineer/bugreport>` for further instructions.

Intermediate Contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should at least have basic knowledge of Java, Python or reST to help out on the following tasks:

* help fixing bugs
* finish the implementation of the API (SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla)
* :doc:`help writing the SpongeDocs <spongedocs>`
* help `translate the Docs on Crowdin <https://crowdin.com/project/sponge-docs>`_
* help out developing Ore

The development of the `Sponge API <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeAPI>`_,
`SpongeForge <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeForge>`_,
`SpongeVanilla <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeVanilla>`_ and `Ore <https://github.com/spongepowered/Ore>`_ as
well as the `SpongeDocs <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeDocs>`_ is done in several repositories hosted on GitHub.

Advanced Contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And finally these are the most difficult things you can help out with. Advanced knowledge of Java, Minecraft and at
least basic knowledge of the `Sponge API <https://github.com/spongepowered/SpongeAPI>`_ and its
`structure <https://jd.spongepowered.org>`_ is strongly advised before attempting to help out with:

* adding functionality to the API (:doc:`implementation/pr`)
* implementing advanced API functionality in the implementations

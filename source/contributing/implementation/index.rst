Developing Sponge
=================

This sections describes the best way to approach the project when you're intending to develop Sponge itself. It is
mandatory to be familiar with :doc:`git <../howtogit>` and our :doc:`codestyle`. Basic knowledge of the
:doc:`/about/structure` is also very helpful.

If you want to join us in creating Sponge, head straight over to the :doc:`pr` page.

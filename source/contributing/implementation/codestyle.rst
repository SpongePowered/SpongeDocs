==========
Code Style
==========

We follow `Google's Java Style Guidelines <https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html>`_ with a
few additions and modifications, which are described herein.

.. tip::
    You can use our code styles for Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA to let your IDE format the code correctly for you. See
    :doc:`/preparing/index` for more information.

* Line endings

  * Use Unix line endings when committing (\\n)

    * Windows users of Git can do ``git config --global core.autocrlf true`` to let Git convert them automatically

* Column width

  * 80 for Javadocs
  * 150 for code
  * Feel free to wrap when it will help with readability

* Indentation

  * Use 4 spaces for indentations, do not use 2 spaces

* Vertical whitespace

  * Place a blank line before the first member of a class, interface, enum, etc. (i.e. after ``class Example {``) as
    well as after the last member

* File headers

  * File headers must contain the license headers for the project. Use the ``updateLicenses`` Gradle task to add them
    automatically

* Imports

  * Imports must be grouped in the following order, where each group is separated by an empty line

    * Static imports
    * All other imports
    * ``java`` imports
    * ``javax`` imports

  * This differs from Google's style in that imports are not grouped by top-level package, they are all grouped as one.

* Exceptions

  * For exceptions that are to be ignored, name the exception variable ``ignored``

* Field accesses

  * Qualify **all** field accesses with ``this``

* Javadocs

  * Do not use ``@author``
  * Wrap additional paragraphs in ``<p>`` and ``</p>``
  * Capitalize the first letter in the descriptions within each "at clause", i.e. ``@param name Player to affect``, no
    periods

* End of file

  * Each file should end with an empty line

Code Conventions
================

* Use :doc:`/plugin/optional/index` instead of returning
  ``null`` in the API
* Method parameters accepting ``null`` must be annotated with ``@Nullable`` (from javax.*), all methods and parameters
  are ``@Nonnull`` by default.
* Use `Google Preconditions <https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/PreconditionsExplained>`_ for null- and
  argument checking.

The Gist
========

While we urge that you read Google's Java conventions particularly, the two are fairly long documents. To get you
started quickly, here is an example of properly formatted code:

Debugging Sponge
================

.. tip::
    See :doc:`../../../plugin/debugging` for debugging a plugin and :ref:`usingDebugger` tips.

Debugging begins with preparing your workspace. At this point, you probably have a working workspace. However, it is 
important to ensure the workspace is setup for the intended purpose. Whether you need to debug SpongeForge, 
SpongeVanilla, SpongeCommon, or SpongeAPI, setup your workspace for a SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla implementation. 
SpongeCommon and SpongeAPI are debugged within the implementation set up. 

See :doc:`../../../about/structure` for more information.

.. note::
    Be sure to read and understand :doc:`../../howtogit` and :doc:`../../versioning` before proceeding.

Setup the Workspace
===================

Here are the steps to setup your workspace if you do not have one already:

1. Clone the implementation.
2. Make changes to the local repository (e.g. create new branch if you will make changes).
3. Setup the implementation.
4. Build the implementation.
5. Run the implementation.

With these instructions successfully completed, you are ready to import the project into your IDE.

.. note::
    This is an outline of the steps necessary to setup the workspace. See the `SpongeForge 
    <https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge>`_ or 
    `SpongeVanilla <https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeVanilla>`_ GitHub pages for complete instructions on 
    cloning, setup, building, and running the implementation.

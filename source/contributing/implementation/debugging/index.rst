Debugging Sponge
================

.. tip::
    See :doc:`../../../plugin/debugging` for debugging a plugin and :ref:`usingDebugger` tips.

Debugging begins with preparing your workspace. At this point, you probably have a working workspace. However, it is 
important to ensure the workspace is setup for the intended purpose. Whether you need to debug SpongeForge, 
SpongeVanilla, SpongeCommon, or SpongeAPI, setup your workspace for a SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla implementation. 
SpongeCommon and SpongeAPI are debugged within the implementation set up. 

See :doc:`../../../about/structure` for more information.

.. note::
    Be sure to read and understand :doc:`../../howtogit` and :doc:`../../versioning` before proceeding.

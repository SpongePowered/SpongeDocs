Debugging Sponge
================

.. tip::
    See :doc:`/plugin/debugging` for debugging a plugin and :ref:`usingDebugger` tips.

These sections provide information for debugging Sponge itself. Whether you need to debug SpongeForge, SpongeVanilla,
SpongeCommon, or SpongeAPI, set up your workspace for a SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla implementation. SpongeCommon and
SpongeAPI are debugged within the implementation setup.

See :doc:`/about/structure` for more information.

.. note::
    Be sure to read and understand :doc:`/contributing/howtogit` and :doc:`/contributing/versioning` as well as the 
    entirety of the :doc:`../index` sections before proceeding.

Setup the Workspace
===================

Here are the steps to setup your workspace if you do not have one already:

1. Clone the implementation.
2. Make changes to the local repository (e.g. create new branch if you will make changes).
3. Setup the implementation.
4. Build the implementation.
5. Run the implementation.

With these instructions successfully completed, you are ready to import the project into your IDE.

.. note::
    This is an outline of the steps necessary to setup the workspace. See the `SpongeForge 
    <https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge>`_ or 
    `SpongeVanilla <https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeVanilla>`_ GitHub pages for complete instructions on 
    cloning, setup, building, and running the implementation.

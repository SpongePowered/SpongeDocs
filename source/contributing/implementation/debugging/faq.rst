- How do I fix my run configurations when a main class is not specified?

  When in the ``Edit Configurations...`` window, select a module that has ``.main`` in its name in the ``Use classpath 
  of module:`` dropdown list.   Click ``Apply``.

- Why does my SpongeVanilla workspace not have a ``genIntelliJRuns`` task?

  This is by design. See `VanillaGradle doesn't have genIntelliJRuns 
  <https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/vanillagradle-doesnt-have-genintellijruns/19091/2>`_ in Sponge Forums for 
  details.

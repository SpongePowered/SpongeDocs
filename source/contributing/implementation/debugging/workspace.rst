===================
Setup the Workspace
===================

With an understanding of Git and GitHub, versions and branches, and how to identify an appropriate git commit, you are 
ready to setup your workspace for debugging. Here are the steps to setup your workspace:

1. Clone the implementation if you have not already.
2. Make changes to the local repository (create new branch, revert to commit, etc.) if you will make changes.
3. Setup the implementation.
4. Build the implementation.
5. Run the implementation.

With these instructions successfully completed, you are ready to import the project into your IDE.

.. note::
    This is an outline of the steps necessary to setup the workspace. See the `SpongeForge 
    <https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge>`_ or 
    `SpongeVanilla <https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeVanilla>`_ GitHub pages for complete instructions on 
    cloning, setup, building, and running the implementation.

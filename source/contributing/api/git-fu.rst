====================
Git-Fu for SpongeAPI
====================

1. ``cd SpongeAPI``

#. ``git pull``

.. tip::
    Bring your master branch current before branching.  ``git pull`` brings your branch (master at this point) up to date before branching it.

#. ``git checkout -b YourBranchName``

.. tip::
    The name of your branch should follow a convention.  Please try to use a name like ``feature/your-feature``

#.  Work with the files, create files, etc..  Do your work in the branch.

#.  When you're done working with the files you can do a check that the
    module will compile.  This would be a good idea before even making
    the commit.

.. tip::
    Run ``gradle compileJava`` to run a simple build of the source files.

#.  When you're convinced that the build of your branch of the SpongeAPI is
    ok then you can commit.

#.  ``git status``

#.  Look for files that are noted as not staged for commit.   Add the
    files that need to be staged for commit.

#.  ``git add FILE(s)``

#.  When all the files are staged for commit, then commit.

#.  ``git commit``

#.  Edit the commit message.  This message should be short and concise.

#.  Now that you've made the commit, you can push this commit to the
    repository.

#.  ``git push``

.. tip::
    If this is the first time you're pushing a commit for this new branch then the branch is not on the upstream remote.  You may see this warning:

    ``fatal: The current branch YourBranchName has no upstream branch.``

To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    ``git push --set-upstream origin YourBranchName``


#.  Once your commit is pushed to the repository, then you can open
    a pull request

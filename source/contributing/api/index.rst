Overview
========

The Sponge API is a community-developed API allowing developers to write plugins for Minecraft servers that run an
implementation of the Sponge API, such as SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla.

We recommend contributors become familiar with the Sponge API `JavaDocs <https://spongepowered.github.io/SpongeAPI/>`__.

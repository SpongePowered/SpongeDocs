API Development
===============

The Sponge API is a community-developed API allowing developers to write plugins for Minecraft servers that run an
implementation of the Sponge API, such as SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla.

We recommend contributors to become familiar with the Sponge API `JavaDocs <https://jd.spongepowered.org/>`__.

Git Workflow for SpongeAPI
==========================

Development of SpongeAPI is focused in a repository on GitHub. Thus, working with Git is an essential element of
contributing.

The process of working with Git is shown below, and assumes a basic knowledge of using the Terminal or command line
for your operating system:

1. Navigate to the directory in which you are working on the project (e.g. ``cd SpongeAPI``).

#. Ensure your master branch is up-to-date with ``git pull``.

#. Create a new branch with ``git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name-here``.

#. Complete your work in the branch - moving files, deleting files, or editing them.

#. Prior to making a commit, ensure the module will compile with ``gradle compileJava``. This will run a simple build
   of the source files.

#. When you are convinced that the build of your branch of SpongeAPI is okay, you may begin to commit. Use ``git status``
   and ``git add FILE(S)`` as necessary to look for files that are not yet staged for a commit.

#. When you are ready, do ``git commit``.

#. Edit the commit message. This message should be detailed, yet concise.

#. You can now push the commit to the repository with ``git push``.

.. tip::

    If you see this warning...

    ``fatal: The current branch YourBranchName has no upstream branch.``

    ...the branch may not be on the upstream remote. This may happen if this is the first time you are pushing a commit
    for the new branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    ``git push --set-upstream origin YourBranchName``

You may open a pull request once your commit is pushed to the repository.

Sponge Documentation
====================

Welcome to the documentation for `Sponge <http://spongepowered.org>`__! Sponge lets people write self-contained plugins for Minecraft that work even across major updates to Minecraft. The project is free to use and open source.

Sponge produces an "API" -- a standard way to write plugins. However, the API is like the DVD standard, a DVD player is required to actually play the DVD. In our case, we both define the standard (the Sponge API) as well as provide one way to run Sponge plugins: on top of Minecraft Forge, which some people may already be familiar with.

Some general issues are addressed in the :doc:`faq`

.. warning::
    Sponge is currently in development as of writing, so no download is yet available for running Sponge plugins.

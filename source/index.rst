Introduction

Welcome to SpongeDocs, the official documentation for the open-source `Sponge <http://spongepowered.org>`__ project.

The Sponge project currently has four main components:

* `SpongeForge <https://github.com/spongepowered/spongeforge>`_
* `SpongeVanilla <https://github.com/spongepowered/spongevanilla>`_
* `SpongeAPI <https://github.com/spongepowered/spongeapi>`_
* `SpongeDocs <https://github.com/spongepowered/spongedocs>`_

.. note::

    Sponge is still in development. Development builds are currently available for `download
    <http://files.minecraftforge.net/spongepowered>`__, but an official release will not be available
    until later in 2015.

Introduction
============

Welcome to SpongeDocs, the official documentation for the open-source `Sponge <https://www.spongepowered.org>`__ project.

SpongeAPI is your all new plugin API for Minecraft: Java Edition. You can run it on a plain vanilla server (as
SpongeVanilla) or on your fully modded MinecraftForge server (as SpongeForge). Check out our :doc:`versions/index` to 
understand selecting a file and grab your copy from our `downloads page <https://www.spongepowered.org/downloads/>`_.

Not sure what you're looking for? Try our :doc:`about/index` section, which contains a short :doc:`about/introduction`,
our :doc:`about/faq` and an article about :doc:`about/structure`.

Server owners should read our tips and instructions in :doc:`server/index` on how to install, run and maintain a Sponge
based server.


The Sponge project has several main components. Learn more about the project structure :doc:`here <about/structure>`

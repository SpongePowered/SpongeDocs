========================
The Sponge Documentation
========================

Welcome to SpongeDocs, the official documentation for the open-source `Sponge <http://spongepowered.org>`__ project.

The Sponge project currently offers two Implementations, **SpongeForge** and **SpongeVanilla**.
Both make use of our **SpongeAPI**.

If you want to dive into Sponge real quick, have a look at our :doc:`server/getting-started/index` section.
You'll learn how to setup your server there. If you want to help us developing Sponge or you're planning to create your
own plugins, then :doc:`plugin/index` and :doc:`contributing/index` are the right places to start. If you want to know
more about Sponge, then give :doc:`about/index` a try.

If you just want to download SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla, then head to :doc:`downloads`.

.. note::

    Sponge is still in development. Development builds are currently available for :doc:`download <downloads>`, but an official
    release will not be available until later in 2015.

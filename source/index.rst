Sponge Documentation

Introduction
============

Welcome to SpongeDocs, the official documentation for the open-source `Sponge <http://spongepowered.org>`__ project.

The SpongeAPI is your all new plugin API for Minecraft. You can run it on a plain vanilla server (as SpongeVanilla) or
on your fully modded MinecraftForge server (as SpongeForge). Grab your copy :doc:`here <downloads>`.

Not sure what you're looking for? Try our :doc:`about/index` section, which contains a short :doc:`about/introduction`,
our :doc:`about/faq` and an article about :doc:`about/structure`.

Server owners should read our tips and instructions in :doc:`server/index` on how to install, run and maintain a Sponge
based server.


The Sponge project has several main components. Learn more about the project structure :doc:`here <about/structure>`
or visit their repositories on GitHub: 

`SpongeForge <https://github.com/spongepowered/spongeforge>`_ |
`SpongeVanilla <https://github.com/spongepowered/spongevanilla>`_ | `SpongeAPI <https://github.com/spongepowered/spongeapi>`_ |
`SpongeDocs <https://github.com/spongepowered/spongedocs>`_ | `SpongeHome <https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeHome>`_ |
`Mixin <https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin>`_ |  `Ore <https://github.com/SpongePowered/Ore>`_

.. note::

    Sponge is still in development. Beta builds of both SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla are currently
    available for :doc:`downloads`, but an official release will not be available until later in 2016.

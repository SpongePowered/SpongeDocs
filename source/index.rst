Introduction
============

Welcome to SpongeDocs, the official documentation for the open-source `Sponge <https://www.spongepowered.org>`__ project.

The SpongeAPI is your all new plugin API for Minecraft. You can run it on a plain vanilla server (as SpongeVanilla) or
on your fully modded MinecraftForge server (as SpongeForge). Grab your copy
`here <https://spongepowered.org/downloads>`_.

Not sure what you're looking for? Try our :doc:`about/index` section, which contains a short :doc:`about/introduction`,
our :doc:`about/faq` and an article about :doc:`about/structure`.

Server owners should read our tips and instructions in :doc:`server/index` on how to install, run and maintain a Sponge
based server.


The Sponge project has several main components. Learn more about the project structure :doc:`here <about/structure>`
or visit their repositories on GitHub:

========================
Installing a Text Editor
========================

Articles on SpongeDocs are saved as text files in the `reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ markup
language. Although your operating system's default text editor is likely sufficient for editing these files, installing
a different text editor may prove to be useful.

Installing an IDE

What is an IDE?
===============

The installation of an IDE - also known as an integrated development environment - is recommended for developing Sponge
plugins and/or working on Sponge itself. An IDE auto-completes names and notifies you of errors, such as mismatched
braces, in your code.

Which one should I choose?
==========================

Every IDE has its pros and cons, and there is no single best IDE for Sponge development. The IDE you choose to use is
largely a matter of personal preference. That being said, it is worth mentioning that `IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
<https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download>`__ is fairly popular amongst a majority of the core Sponge team.
